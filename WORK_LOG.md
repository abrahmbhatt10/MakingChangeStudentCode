| 1/27 | 1:15 - 1:45pm |                                                         I brainstormed in class. I thought about a recursive approach. I didn't make much progress though. |
| 1/28 |   8:30 - 9    | I made new functions. Each function was called countOne to count three. It would figure out for x number of coins, the x possible combinations and return. |                                                                                                 |
| 1/28 |   9 - 9:30    |           I thought of making a table. The table would have combination of different values. The table does permutation combination for different numbers. |
| 1/29 | 10:55 - 11:25 |                        I decided to use a recursive approach in multiplier. I used a partial sum. This is the sum that doesn't necessarily hit the target. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
