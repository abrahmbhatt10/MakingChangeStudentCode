| 1/27 | 1:15 - 1:45pm |                                                                                                                  I brainstormed in class. I thought about a recursive approach. I didn't make much progress though. |
| 1/28 |   8:30 - 9    |                                                          I made new functions. Each function was called countOne to count three. It would figure out for x number of coins, the x possible combinations and return. |                                                                                                 |
| 1/28 |   9 - 9:30    |                                                                    I thought of making a table. The table would have combination of different values. The table does permutation combination for different numbers. |
| 1/29 | 10:55 - 11:25 |                                                                                 I decided to use a recursive approach in multiplier. I used a partial sum. This is the sum that doesn't necessarily hit the target. |
| 1/29 |  8:30 - 9pm   |                                                                                                                    I finished debugging. The three tests passed. Others passed after I increased the timeout limit. |
| 2/4  |  6:00 - 6:30  |                                                                        I wrote the initial code. However, I realized that I was mixing up tabulation and memoization technique. I decided to code tabulation first. |
| 2/4  |   6:30 - 7    |                               I coded tabulation first because it seemed easier. I realized when the coin change was a factor of the target, there was double counting. I fixed that, however, with includeCount(). |
| 2/4  |   7:30 - 8    |                                        I tested code and it started working. I reviewed geeks for geeks tutorial on memoization to understand it better before coding. I changed to recursive code for memoization. |
| 2/4  |   8 - 8:30    | I tested the code. It started working. I reduced the time limit and tested the tests again to the original time limit set by Mr. Blick, and the original tests passed within the time limit. I then added comments. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
